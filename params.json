In this environment, students will have the opportunity to build, to break, and to learn from their failures. We aim to introduce students to some of the complexity of systems and the concept of design optimization – skills they will carry forth throughout their career.\r\n\r\nStudents that are interested in creating a repository should contact Matthew Nelson (@matgyver)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
