<hr><p>The repositories located here are from student projects that are in the <a href="http://www.aere.iastate.edu/m2i/">Make to Innovate (M:2:I)</a> program that is in the <a href="http://www.aere.iastate.edu">Aerospace Engineering Department</a> at <a href="www.iastate.edu">Iowa State University</a>.  </p>

<p>Make To Innovate (M:2:I) is an exciting new program in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University which engages students in hands-on projects to augment their understanding of engineering fundamentals.</p>

<p>In recent testimony to Congress, Regina Dugan, the DARPA Director, spoke of one of our nation’s biggest challenges – the decline in our ability to make things.</p>

<p>Simply stated, “to innovate, we must be able to make”.</p>

<p>We intend to revolutionize our approach to design by introducing “Make to Innovate”, in which students will learn how to design and operate aerospace systems.</p>

<p>The M:2:I lab allows for the free flow of design creativity to address real-world problems. In this environment, students will have the opportunity to build, to break, and to learn from their failures. We aim to introduce students to some of the complexity of systems and the concept of design optimization – skills they will carry forth throughout their career.</p>
